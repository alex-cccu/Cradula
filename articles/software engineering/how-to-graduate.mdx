## Introduction

Having both started my Software Engieering career through a graduate scheme, as
well as being involved in their recruitment process as a mid-weight, I believe
that there's likely to be some nuggets of wisdom deep down inside of me that I'm
hoping to be able to pry out by writing this article. So if you're an
up-and-coming engineer fresh out of uni, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, yet to
become jaded by the industry and looking to apply for their first role - this
one goes out to you.

In this piece, I hope to outline some of my experience, what to expect, pitfalls
to avoid, and some general advice on how to get recruited.

I'm also planning on writing a follow-up to this with some advice on how to make
the most of your graduate scheme once you land yourself one, so please keep your
eyes peeled for that too!

## In the beginning

_"Now what?"_ A question that will be all too familiar for most developers. It's
something we all end up asking ourselves at some point in our careers, usually
several times but especially towards the beginning.

In 2019 I was there too, fumbling my way through university with not just the
deadlines of exams and coursework looming overhead, but also the reality of
finally having to find my own way in the world.

So, when that benevolent and golden handshake of nepotism didn't extend its open
palm my way, I found myself left with only a few options:

- I could just sit in my gloomy bedroom, taking an extended and undetermined
  amount of time to think very long and very hard about what I might do next.
  Meanwhile letting opportunity after opportunity pass me by, wasting away the
  days on whatever degenerate game was the flavour of the week.
- I could get a _normal_ job, working in some grey office on the phones or
  begrudgingly upping my hours at the local supermarket job that had helped pay
  my way through university.
- I could jump into the junior engineer market with everyone else — something
  several of my peers were doing with very little success.

The truth of the matter was that none of these options felt right for me, and I
could feel the stress of uncertainty building as the days and weeks went on. So
I decided to talk to one of my lecturers about the options I was in a rut about
and see what his thoughts were. He had just come from the industry himself and
so I was hopeful that he might be able to give me some fresh ideas. It was in
that very conversation that I first heard the term **"graduate scheme"**. My
lecturer, who was relatively young compared to my other lecturers, had started
his own career on one less than a decade prior, and he sold them well.

So off I went, doing some of my own research into what various schemes offered,
and I quickly decided that this was the just the thing I had been looking for.

Now all I had to do was actually convince someone to let me on one!

## Application fever

Like Yoda to Luke, here comes my first piece of sage, highly quotable and almost
certainly life-changing wisdom:

> "Don't be too picky"

_Boom!_ Mind-blowing, right? Well, I very nearly missed the boat on graduate
schemes altogether by doing the exact opposite. I began, foolishly, by
exclusively picking _cool_ companies. You know, the kind you can slip into a
conversation with your socially awkward and undiagnosed autistic mates to raise
a few eyebrows. For the most part, this consisted of game studios, both computer
and tabletop, and anything that had a little glamour attached to the name.

When I tell you that I ended up working for Tesco, a supermarket chain in the UK
with one of the most boring logos in the history of graphic design, you'll be
unsurprised to hear that this did not quite fit into my initial criteria. The
perpetual explanation of "No, I don't work on the tills, I actually build them"
does not have the same gravitas as "I'm working for Rockstar on the new GTA."
However, my experience on Tesco's graduate scheme was completely invaluable, and
I would not change it for the world.

The first thing that I missed with my inital approach, one which I think most
people try in the beginning, was that you need to apply for **a lot** of
schemes. It's a tough old market out there, and it has only gotten harder in the
years since I was fighting for my place in it. Each scheme can have hundreds (if
not thousands for the most popular ones) of applicants, with only a small
handful of positions available. This measn that even if you're an excellent
candidate (which I'm sure that you are), you still have a very reasonable chance
of not making the cut.

This shouldn't be disheartening though. There are plenty of schemes out there,
and everyone else is in the same boat. The best way to tackle this is play the
numbers game. By only applying for your four or five favourite schemes, you're
not particularly swinging the pendulum in your favour. But by grinding out 25,
50, or even 100 applications (yes I mean it) you give yourself a serious chance.

Now, these numbers probably seem daunting, especially when you've got plenty of
other things to juggle alongside job hunting, but this is the reality whether
you're apply for graduate schemes or junior jobs these days. I promise you that,
with time, these applications do become easier. You'll be able to reuse sections
of them, and with such low conversion rates, you'll likely not have to face too
many interviews.

For example, I applied for around 40 graduate schemes in total whilst juggling
university and a part-time job. From that I got asked to interview 3 times, and
got 1 offer (which I took). It's certainly possible that for some this is a much
easier process, but I supsect most will have a similar experience or find it
even tougher in the current climate.

The second problem with being picky about where you apply is time. Graduate
schemes are only open for a fairly small window of the year, typically from
September through to January. And though you might still find some available in
February and March, there are many more that close their applications in October
and November. Typically, you can only apply for these during your final year at
university (this includes Masters and PhD years), as well as the year directly
after you graduate. So that gives you two very short windows to apply before the
opportunity is gone and you've missed out.

Sometimes you'll get a reply pretty quickly; more and more the initial
application process ends up being automated due to the sheer volume of
applicants. However, other times it might take several months to get
confirmation of whether you've made it through to the next stage or not. So when
you put all your job-hunting eggs into one basket, holding out as I did for a
reply from that one perfect company you've always dreamed of working for, you
can find yourself very short on time when that company turns you down weeks of
hearing nothing. Meaning you'll have missed the boat on hundreds of other
perfectly good opportunities

Luckily, in my case, I was able to quickly pivot my method of attack, but for
many there won't be enough time. So don't make the same mistake.

I must stress however: please do at least a few minutes of reading about the
companies you're applying for, or you might find yourself on the graduate scheme
from hell.

## Applying for dummies

Now for my second piece of reality-shattering advice:

> "Don't use AI"

Yep. That's it. Pretty simple, but advice that I fear a lot of people need.

When I was applying all those eons ago, back in the time before time, the ripe
old year of 2019, I didn't even have the option. Now you can hardly breath for
it. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand the temptation, especially given my
first piece of advice and the need to produce an extensive number of
applications, but for your own sake, please don't.

When applying for one of these schemes (and this also applies to junior
developer rolesso listen up), you'll often have to provide some sort of CV,
cover letter, or portfolio. The recruiters whose job it is to read through all
of these will often have to sift through hundreds of them, so popping "Write me
a cover letter for X role at Y company" into your AI chatbot of choice doesn't
quite cut the mustard. I promise you, from experience, that once you've seen a
few cookie-cutter AI applications you can sniff them out a mile off.

Make it creative, make it unique, make it yours.

Let's say, however, that you manage to make it through the first phase of the
application process, sat at home with a big cheesy grin and absolutely chuffed
to bits that you've managed to cheat the system. Well you'll more than likely
find yourself faced with some sort of coding assessment and a video inteview.
This happens to be where I spent most of my time whilst supporting the graduate
recruitment process at Tesco and I was completely shocked at the number of
candidates trying to con their way through the process using AI.

I think for the most part that this stems from a misunderstanding of what
companies want from their applicants. My belief is that most people faced with a
coding assessment assume they have to complete the problem perfectly in order to
proceed, which couldn't be further from the truth.

When applying for graduate schemes, differently from the requirements I've seen
on junior developer roles, the expectation is that you are very limited in your
experience. They want to be able to take you under their wing, invest in you,
and mould you into the perfect little engineer for their company. This means
they're much less interested in your ability to code or whether you got the
right answer, and instead want to see how you tackle the question. Are you able
to think about problems in the right way? Are you showing the signs of what it
takes to be a good engineer? Are you able to fail forwards?

So when another engineer, someone like myself (hi!), goes to watch the playback
of your assessment and sees that you were inactive on the assssment tab for five
minutes before pasting in a perfect answer, that tells us absolutely nothing
about how you think and work as a developer.

Oh, sorry! Did I forget to mention that they can see everything you do during
the assessment? I'm afraid so. While I was reviewing applications in late 2024
and early 2025, I estimate that around two thirds of applicants were copy and
pasting the entire answer. There are some incredible tools out there that the
big tech firms use to track everything in your browser tab whilst completing the
test: full playbacks of the window, showing every character you type as you type
them as well as seeing exactly when you paste in a perfectly crafted - and
suspiciously commented - answer.

I think people also forget that they're not the only ones to have ever used AI.
It is an ever growing part of an engineer's job, and so all of those who review
your application will have used it many, many times before. There are tells that
we're all used to. So though you might feel you're being clever, I'm afraid
everyone knows exactly what you're doing. Very embarrassing.

There will be those of you out there who won't heed this advice and will now try
and mask what you're doing even further. I promise you, you'll be found out. The
takeaway from this should be that it's okay to get things wrong. It's how we
learn. And that's exactly what they want to see.

Give it a go on your own, write your own code, show us that you're human.

## Everyone's interested in LLMs

For my final gravestone-worth quote, and boy is this one a doozy:

> "Be interested in technology"

Gosh, that's broad isn't it? But it's true, and something I think a lot of
applicants get wrong.

Usually, at some point during the application process, you'll have a
face-to-face interview with an engineer or have to submit a video Q&A to be
reviewed. As part of this, you'll more than likely be asked a question like:
_"What piece of emerging technology most interests you?"_

Before you slam your gameshow buzzer and shout "AI!" before the host has
finished asking you the question, take a moment to think.

Whether it's because people pick the career for the paycheck and aren't actually
interested, or because they just don't have the time to keep up with the latest
technology, you'd be shocked at how bad the answers to questions like this can
be.

Now, the expectation is not that a graduate fresh out of university will be a
subject-matter expert on the latest and greatest. However, what companies do
want to see is a spark of passion. Nintey percent of the applications I reviewed
gave the answer: _"I'm really interested in LLMs."_

Which is totally _fine_, but when everyone else is giving the same generic
answer, it doesn't help you stand out from the crowd.

This is not me saying you can't be interested in LLMs and AI by the way, quite
far from it. AI is probably the most important and exciting field in technology
right now. But it is also an incredibly vast field. So instead of something
surface-level, try to dig a little deeper. Find something that genuinely excites
or interests you. Maybe it's how AI can be used to make energy consumption more
efficient, how it could help doctors diagnose earlier or even its impact on the
agricultural sector. Find something that interests you, read some articles, pick
through some research papers, learn about the topic and how the tech works.
Learn about its flaws and weaknesses. Plus you'll get some bonus points if you
can relate the technology to the company you're applying to.

And again, please don't just use AI to generate a canned answer. We can tell.
You're vastly more likely to get thrown out for it than for having a sub-par
answer that has at least been clearly been thought about.

## Conclusions

Applying for graduate schemes is tough. There's no two ways about it. The market
is absolutely crammed with applicants right now, and standing out in that crowd
is difficult. However, if you're reading this article, then you're already
putting yourself at an advantage. You're showing that you're genuinely
interested in bettering yourself to get a role that is all about learning and
developing.

Just make sure you're doing the following and you'll be in with an excellent
chance:

- **Apply for plenty**. You might be surprised to find that some of the more
  boring-sounding companies actually have the most interesting problems to solve
  and opportunities to learn.
- **Don't use AI**. You'll get caught. Graduate schemes are companies taking a
  chance on an inexperienced developer. If you're not willing to give them the
  time for a proper application, then why would they give you their time and
  money to train you up?
- **Show some passion**. Be interested in technology. It's a difficult and
  consuming career, so if you don't care for the subject, then maybe it's just
  not for you.

Thank you so much for reading my article. Hopefully you found it insightful, and
there's at least a little piece of wisdom to take from this that can help you on
your journey! Please look out for my follow-up article on how to make the most
of a graduate scheme once you're on one too!

I wish you the very best of luck in your applications and future career!
