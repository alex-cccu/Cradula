## Intro

Having started my career as a Software Engineer through a graduate scheme,
before then becoming involved in its recruitment process as a mid-weight, I
believe there might be some wisdom deep down inside me that I'm hoping to pry
out by writing this article. This one goes out to any up-and-coming engineers
fresh out of uni, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, looking to apply for their first
role.

In this piece, I hope to outline some of my experience, what to expect, pitfalls
to avoid, and some general advice on how to get recruited.

I also plan on writing a follow-up to this with some advice on how to make the
most of your graduate scheme once you land one, so keep your eyes peeled for
that too!

## In the beginning

_"Now what?"_ A question that will be all too familiar for most developers. We
all end up asking ourselves it at some point in our careers, especially towards
the beginning.

Several years ago, I was there too, fumbling my way through university with not
just the deadlines of exams and coursework looming overhead, but also the
reality of having to find my own way in the world for the first time once that
final submission was handed in.

So, when that benevolent and golden hand of nepotism didn't extend its open palm
my way, I felt I was left with a few options:

- I could just sit in my bedroom, taking an undetermined amount of time to think
  long and hard about what to do next while opportunities passed me by and I
  wasted away the hours playing whatever the latest hype game was.
- I could get a _normal_ job, working in some grey office or begrudgingly upping
  my hours in the supermarket job I had at the time.
- I could jump into the junior engineer market with everyone else — something
  several of my peers were doing, but was hard enough in 2020, let alone 2025.

None of these seemed like the right option for me, and I could feel the stress
building as the days and weeks went on. So I decided to talk to one of my
lecturers about these options and see what he thought. He had just come from
industry himself, and so I felt he might be able to give me some fresh ideas. It
was in that very conversation that I first heard the term **“graduate scheme”**.
My lecturer, who was relatively young, had started his own career on one less
than a decade prior, and he sold them well. So off I went, doing some of my own
research into what various courses offered, and I quickly decided that this was
the perfect way forward for me.

Now the challenge was to convince someone to let me onto one!

## Application fever

Like Yoda to Luke, here comes my first piece of sage, highly quotable and
life-changing wisdom:

> "Don't be too picky"

Mind-blowing, right? Well, I very nearly missed the boat on graduate schemes
completely by doing the exact opposite. I began, foolishly, by picking
exclusively _cool_ companies. You know, the kind you can slip into a
conversation with your socially awkward and undiagnosed autistic mates to raise
a few eyebrows. For the most part, this consisted of games companies, both
computer and tabletop, and anything else that had some glamour attached to the
name.

When I tell you that I ended up working for Tesco, a supermarket chain in the
UK, you'll be unsurprised to hear that this did not quite fit into my initial
criteria. The perpetual explanation of "No, I don't work on the tills, I
actually build them" does not have the same ring to it as "Yeah, I guess I do
work for Netflix." However, my experience on their graduate scheme was
completely invaluable, and I wouldn't change it for the world.

The first problem with my approach, one which I think many people try in the
beginning, was that you need to apply for **a lot** of schemes. It's a tough old
market out there, and it has only gotten harder in the years since I was
fighting in it. Each scheme can have hundreds (if not thousands, for the most
popular ones) of applicants, with only a handful of positions available. This
means that even if you're an excellent candidate, you still have a very
reasonable chance of not making the cut.

This shouldn't be disheartening though. There are plenty of schemes out there,
and everyone else is in the same boat. So the best way to tackle this problem is
to play the numbers game. By only applying for your five favourite schemes,
you're not particularly swinging the pendulum in your favour. But by grinding
out 25, 50, or even 100 applications (yes, I mean it), you give yourself a
serious chance.

These numbers might seem daunting, especially when you've got plenty of other
things to juggle alongside job hunting, but this is the reality whether you're
applying for graduate schemes or junior jobs these days. I promise you that,
with time, these applications become easier. You'll be able to reuse sections of
them, and with such low conversion rates, you'll likely not have to face too
many interviews.

The second problem with being picky is time. Graduate schemes are only open for
a small window of the year, typically from September through to January. Though
you may still find some available in February and March, there are many more
that close applications in October and November. Typically, you can only apply
for these during your final year at university (this includes Masters and PhD
years), as well as the year directly after you graduate. This gives you two very
short windows to apply before the opportunity is missed.

Sometimes you'll get a reply pretty quickly; more and more, the initial
application process is automated due to the sheer volume of applicants. However,
other times it might take several months to get confirmation of whether you've
made it through or not. So when you put all your job-hunting eggs in one basket,
holding out, as I did, for a reply from that one perfect company you've always
dreamt of working for, you can find yourself very short on time when that
company turns you down after weeks and weeks of deliberation, meaning you'll
have missed the boat on hundreds of other perfectly good opportunities.

Luckily, in my case, I was able to quickly pivot my method of attack, but for
many there won't be enough time. So don't make the same mistake.

I must stress, however: please do at least a few minutes reading about the
companies you're applying for, or you might end up on a graduate scheme for
illegal gambling or litter picking.

## Applying for dummies

Now for my second piece of reality-shattering advice:

> "Don't use AI"

Yep. That's it. Pretty simple, but advice that I fear a lot of people need.

When I was applying eons ago, back in the time before time, the ripe old year of
2019, I didn't even have the option. Now you can hardly move for it. I totally
understand the temptation, especially given my first piece of advice and the
need to produce an extensive number of applications, but for your own sake,
don't.

When applying for one of these schemes (and this also applies to junior
developer roles), you'll often have to provide some sort of CV, cover letter, or
portfolio. The recruiters whose job it is to read through all of these will
often have to sift through hundreds, so popping "Write me a cover letter for X
role at Y company" into your favourite AI chatbot doesn't quite cut the mustard.
I promise you, from experience, that once you've seen a few cookie-cutter AI
applications you can sniff them out a mile off.

Make it creative, make it unique, make it yours.

Let's say, however, that you manage to make it through the first phase of
application. You'll then more than likely be faced with some sort of coding
assessment and maybe a video interview. This is where I spent most of my time
when supporting the graduate recruitment process at Tesco, and I was certainly
shocked at the number of candidates trying to con their way through the process
using AI.

I think for the most part this stems from a misunderstanding of what companies
want from their applicants. My belief is that most people faced with a coding
assessment assume they have to complete the problem perfectly in order to
proceed, which couldn't be further from the truth.

When applying for graduate schemes, differently from the requirements I've seen
on junior developer roles, the expectation is that you are very limited in
experience. They want to be able to take you under their wing, invest in you,
and mould you into the perfect little engineer for their company. This means
they're much less interested in your ability to code perfectly or whether you
got the right answer, and more interested in how you tackle the question. Are
you able to think about problems in the right way? Are you showing the signs of
what it takes to be a good engineer? Are you able to fail forwards?

So when another engineer, like myself, goes back to review your code and sees
that you were inactive on the assessment tab for five minutes before pasting in
a perfect answer, that tells us absolutely nothing about how you think and work
as a developer. Oh, sorry! Did I forget to mention that we can see everything
you do during the assessment? I'm afraid so. While I was reviewing applications
in late 2024 and early 2025, I would estimate that around two out of three
applicants were copying and pasting the entire answer. There are some incredible
tools out there that companies are using that track everything you do within the
browser tab whilst completing the test: full playbacks of the tab, showing every
character you type and every time you paste in a perfectly crafted - and
suspiciously commented - answer.

I think people also forget that they're not the only ones to have ever used AI.
It is part of an engineer's job, and so all of those who review your application
will have used it many, many times. There are tells that we've all seen 1,000
times. So though you might feel you're being clever, I'm afraid everyone knows
exactly what you're doing.

Now please do not take this as a call to arms to go and find out how to mask
what you're doing. The takeaway should be that it's okay to get things wrong.
Give it a go on your own, write your own code, show us that you're human.

## "I'm really interested in LLMs"

For my final piece of advice, here's another gravestone-worthy quote:

> "Be interested in technology"

Gosh, that's broad, isn't it? But it's true, and something I think a lot of
applicants get wrong.

Usually, at some point during the application process, you'll have a
face-to-face interview with someone or have to submit a video Q&A for someone to
review. And in this, you'll probably be asked a question like: _"What piece of
emerging technology most interests you?"_

Whether it's because people pick the career for the paycheck and aren't actually
interested, or because they just don't have time to keep up with the latest tech
trends whilst also trying to juggle university, you'd be shocked at how bad the
answers to questions like this can be.

Now, the expectation is not that a graduate fresh out of university will be a
subject-matter expert on the latest and greatest. However, what companies do
want to see is passion. Ninety percent of the applications I reviewed gave the
answer: _"I'm really interested in LLMs."_

Which is _fine_, but when everyone else is giving the same generic answer, it
doesn't help you stand out from the crowd.

This is not me saying you can't be interested in LLMs and AI, far from it. AI is
probably the most important and exciting field in technology right now. But it
is also an incredibly vast field. So instead of something surface-level, dig a
little deeper. Find something that genuinely excites or interests you. Maybe
it's how it can be used to make energy consumption more efficient, or how it
could help doctors diagnose earlier. Find something that interests you, read
some articles, read some research papers, learn about the topic and how the tech
works. Bonus points if you pick something that relates to the company you're
applying to.

And again, please don't just use AI to generate a canned answer. We can tell —
and you're vastly more likely to get thrown out for it than for having a sub-par
answer that you've clearly thought about.

## Conclusions

Applying for graduate schemes is tough. There's no two ways about it. The market
is absolutely crammed with applicants right now, and standing out in that crowd
is difficult. However, if you're reading this article, then you're already
putting yourself at an advantage. You're showing you're genuinely interested in
bettering yourself to get a role that is all about learning and developing.

Just make sure you're doing the following and you'll be in with an excellent
chance:

- **Apply for plenty**. You might be surprised that some of the more
  boring-sounding companies actually have the most interesting problems to solve
  and opportunities available.
- **Don't use AI**. You'll get caught. Graduate schemes are companies taking a
  chance on an inexperienced developer. If you're not willing to give them the
  time for a proper application, then why would they give you their time and
  money to train you up?
- **Show some passion**. Be interested in technology. It's a difficult and
  consuming career, so if you don't care for the subject, then maybe it's just
  not for you.

Thank you so much for reading my article. Hopefully you found it insightful, and
there's at least a little piece of wisdom to take from this that can help you on
your journey! Please look out for my follow-up article on how to make the most
of a graduate scheme once you're on one too!

I wish you the very best of luck in your applications and future career!
