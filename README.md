### The Build

This site is built using Next.js and Tailwind. Tested in Vitest and using Gray Matter to translate markdown files into articles.

### Running

To run the site locally first please make sure you do a fresh install after pulling the code locally

```bash
npm ci
```

Then, to start the site

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the site on `http://localhost:3000/`

If you would like to run the tests locally as well, you can run

```
